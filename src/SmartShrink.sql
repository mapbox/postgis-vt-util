### SmartShrink ###

Buffers a polygon progressively (on an exponential scale) until the
area of the result hits a certain threshold ratio to the original area.
The result is also simplified with a tolerance matching the inset
distance.

__Parameters:__

- `geometry` g - A (multi)polygon.
- `float` ratio - The threshold for how much smaller (by area) you want
  the shrunk polygon to be compared to the original. Eg a value of 0.6
  would result in a polygon that is at least 60% as large as the input.
- `boolean` simplify - Defaults to false. Whether or not you would
  like the shrunk geometry simplified.

__Returns:__ `geometry`
